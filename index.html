<p><u><strong><a href="https://uniswapbing.github.io/">Uniswap Exchange</a></strong></u> is a type of crypto exchange that uses a decentralised network protocol. No single entity owns and operates it, using a relatively new trading design known as automated liquidity protocol. This exchange is also wholly open-source. Therefore it is easy for users to copy the code to create their decentralised exchanges. Users can also quickly enlist the tokens on the exchange for free. Regular centralised exchanges are subjected to profit-making and cost very high fees to list new coins. It is a tremendous difference. Users are in charge of their funds, meaning they have complete supervision of funds at all times compared to a centralised business because Uniswap Exchange is a decentralised exchange (DEX). Also, centralised exchange traders give up control of their private keys so that orders can be logged on an internal database rather than be executed on a blockchain since it is more energy-absorbing and high-priced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Preserving control of private keys removes the danger of losing possessions on having the exchange hacked. Traders must know that Uniswap works on two intelligent contracts. They are an &quot;Exchange&quot; contract and a &quot;Factory&quot; contract.</p>

<h3><strong>Purchase Ethereum</strong></h3>

Navigate to your Ethereum position on your exchange. Then, you should see an option to send your Ethereum. Just press on this and write the address via your wallet. Next, click send, and your ETH will be in your wallet within two-three minutes.</p>

<h3><strong>Connect your wallet to Uniswap &nbsp;Exchange</strong></h3>

<p>It is easy to access Uniswap&#39;s app once you have an ETH wallet. You will see an option to connect the wallet in the top right-hand corner. You need to tap it and choose from the options of featured wallets. Make sure you are using the MetaMask chrome extension because you will be able to log in automatically. Else, you may have to enter some information using another supported wallet. Once a user has built a connection between a wallet and Uniswap, you are ready to use the technology.</p>
